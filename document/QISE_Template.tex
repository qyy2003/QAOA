\begin{abstract}
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The depth $p$ and the chosen parameters can greatly influence the algorithm's performance. Based on related papers, we implement unitary matrix operator simulation, deploy three methods to optimize $\vec{\gamma}, \vec{\beta}$ and compare their performance. Then we construct the quantum circuits and use qiskit SDK to simulate them. Besides, we test  our quantum circuits' performance under real IBM Quantum Machines noise. Lastly, We study the influence of $p$ on QAOA for a given graph, and lots of results are analyzed. Our codes are available at  \href{https://github.com/qyy2003/QAOA}{github}

\section{Background}
\subsection{Combinatorial Optimization Problem}
Given $n$ bits and $m$ clauses, the combinatorial optimization problem asks for a string $z=z_1z_2...z_n$ that maximize the cost function 
\begin{equation}
  C(z) = \sum_{\alpha=1}^mC_{\alpha}(z)
\end{equation}
where $C_{\alpha}=1$ if $z$ satisfies clause $\alpha$ and $0$ if it doesn't satisfies.
Usually, finding optimization solutions is hard and costly using classical algorithms, but it is relatively 
easier to achieve an approximate solution close to the maximum of $C(z)$. This kind of method is called 
approximate optimization algorithm.  The performance of an approximate optimization algorithm is guaranteed by an approximate ratio of $R$
such that 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{C(z)}{\max_{z}C(z)}\ge R
\end{equation}

\subsection{Maximum Cut}

\begin{problem}[Maximum Cut (MaxCut)]
Given a graph $G =(V, E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ weighted edges, separate 
$V$ into two disjoint sets $S$ and $T$ to maximize the sum of weights of edges $(u, v)$ 
such that $u\in S, v\in T$ or $v\in S, u\in T$.
\end{problem}

The MaxCut problem is a well-known combinatorial optimization 
problem. The problem is NP-hard and APX-hard, meaning that no polynomial-time 
algorithm has been found and the approximate ratio obtained by polynomial-time algorithms
cannot be arbitrarily close to the optimal solution unless $NP=P$. 

The quantum computer works under the $2^n$ dimensional Hilbert space. To solve the combinatorial optimization problem, 
it is expected to construct a Hamiltonian (phase Hamiltonian) $C$ such that
\begin{equation}
    C\ket{z}=C(z)\ket{z}
    \label{eq:parallelism}
\end{equation}
where $\ket{z}$ is a base in computational basis. In this way, the problem of finding the maximum of $C(z)$ changes into finding the extremal eigenvalue for the phase Hamiltonian.

\begin{definition}[Phase Hamiltonian]
The phase Hamiltonian for the MaxCut problem is constructed as
\begin{equation}
    C=\sum_{\langle jk\rangle}\frac{w_{jk}}{2}(1-\sigma_j^z\sigma_k^z)
\end{equation}
where $w_{jk}$ is the weight of edge $\langle jk \rangle$.
\end{definition}
Let's take the $2^2$ dimensional Hilbert space as an example to see how this construction works.
If there is an edge between the two vertices, then 
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_0^z\sigma_1^z = 
    \left( \begin{matrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{matrix} \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    C = \frac{w}{2}(1-\sigma_0^z\sigma_1^z)=
    \left( \begin{matrix}
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & w & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & w & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{matrix} \right)
\end{equation}

This means that the result of $C\vert z\rangle$ is equal to $w$ if and only if the two vertices 
are in different sets, i.e., $\vert z \rangle = \vert 01\rangle$ or $\vert z \rangle =\vert 10\rangle$. Taking the sum over all 
edges, we can prove that this construction satisfies Equation~\ref{eq:parallelism}.

\subsection{QAA: Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm}

Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm is a method raised around 2000 to solve combinatorial search problems~\cite{farhi2000quantum}. The algorithm 
begins with an initial state $|s\rangle$ which is the groudn state of $B$. Then it constructs a time-dependent Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
    H(t)=(1-\frac{t}{T})B+\frac{t}{T}C 
\end{equation} 

Let the system evolve according to the Schr√∂dinger equation for a sufficiently long time $T$. The system is expected to 
stay in the ground state over the smooth evolution. In the end, the ground state of $H(T) = C$ can be obtained.

However, in practical situations, the long evolution time can be intolerable. 
In addition, the energy levels change continuously over time $T$, and in some occasions, two 
energy levels may be pretty near or even cross each other. If this happens to the two lowest energy levels, 
the system will jump into the other energy level and leave the ground state. This means that a long-time evolution cannot guarantee
the maximum answer to be found. These drawbacks greatly limit the performance of QAA.

\section{Algorithm specification}

Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) uses 
a Trotterized approximation of QAA to obtain a quantum gate model algorithm~\cite{farhi2014quantum}.
It separates the continuous evolution process into countable stages and repeatedly applies the short-time evolution of the Phase Operator and the Mix operator to get a state similar to the desired ground state.

\subsection{Operator Definition}
\begin{definition}[Phase operator]
Define the Phase Operator as 
\begin{equation}
    U(C, \gamma)=e^{-i\gamma C}
\end{equation} 
\end{definition}
where $\gamma\in [0, 2\pi]$ because $C$ is a diagonal matrix with integar elements. 
The phase operator can be regarded as applying the Phase Hamiltonian for a short time proportion
to $\gamma$.

\begin{definition}[Mix Hamiltonian]
Define the Mix Hamiltonian as 
\begin{equation}
    B=\sum_{i=1}^n\sigma_i^x
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
This Hamiltonian is constructed for convenient preparation of the initial state. 
The ground state of this Hamiltonian is simply a sum over all computational basis
\begin{align*}
    |s\rangle = |+\rangle^{\oplus n}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_z |z\rangle
\end{align*} 
Therefore, this ground state for $B$ is chosen as the initial state for the evolution.

\begin{definition}[Mix Operator]
Define the Mix Operator as 
\begin{align*}
    U(B, \beta)=e^{-i\beta B}
\end{align*} 
\end{definition}
where $\beta \in [0, \pi]$. Similar to the Phase Operator, this operator functions 
as applying the Mix Hamiltonian for a short time, which is proportioned to $\beta$. 

\subsection{Envolution}

Recall the process of QAA, the long evolution time can 
be cut into multiple small periods of time-independent evolution.
For a small time interval $\Delta t \hbar$ at time $t$, the evolution operator 
can be appropriated by 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
   U \approx e^{-iH(t)\Delta t} &= e^{-i(uB+vC)\Delta t} \\
   &= \lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}(e^{-iuB\Delta t/N}e^{-ivC\Delta t/N})^N
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $u=(1-\frac{t}{T}), v=\frac{t}{T}$. 

Notice that the decomposition operators are just 
in the form of Phase operators or Mix operators, which inspires us to apply these two kinds of 
operators alternatively on the initial state. For a depth $p$ and $2p$ predetermined parameters 
$(\vec{\gamma}, \vec{\beta})$, define a quantum state.
\begin{equation}
    |\vec{\gamma}, \vec{\beta}\rangle=U(B,\beta_p)U(C,\gamma_p)...U(B,\beta_1)U(C,\gamma_1)|s\rangle 
\end{equation}

The expectation of eigenvalues of $C$ when we measure $|\vec{\gamma},\vec{\beta}\rangle$ in computational basis is
\begin{align*}
    F_p(\vec{\gamma}, \vec{\beta}) = \langle\vec{\gamma},\vec{\beta}| C |\vec{\gamma},\vec{\beta}\rangle
\end{align*}

For sufficiently large $p$ and appropriately chosen parameters, the state can evolve into the ground state
of $C$ as discussed above. Therefore, 
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{p\rightarrow \infty}\max_{\vec{\gamma}, \vec{\beta}}{F_p(\vec{\gamma}, \vec{\beta})}=C_{max}(z)
\end{align*}

In reality, we cannot make $p$ as large as infinity, but an approximate solution can be obtained using this 
state for finite $p$. To do this, repeatedly measure $|\vec{\gamma}, \vec{\beta}\rangle$ in computational basis. For each measure 
result $\vert z \rangle$, compute $C(z)$ using traditional computers and keep the maximum number of this value as $\hat{C}(z)$. Over many 
times of measurements, $\hat{C}(z)$ will be close to or greater than $ F_p(\vec{\gamma}, \vec{\beta})$. If we can optimize 
the parameters for this value, then an approximate optimization solution is found.


\section{Circuit Description}

\subsection{The Phase Operator}

The circuit for the Phase Operator $U(C, \gamma)$ varies over different problems and depends on the composition of $C$. 
For the MaxCut problem, $U(C, \gamma)$ can be decomposed into a unitary operator for each edge using Trotter decomposition.
Therefore, we can design the circuit separately for every edge.
\begin{align*}
    U(C, \gamma) &= e^{-i\gamma\sum_{\langle jk\rangle}C_{\langle jk\rangle}}\\
    &=\Pi_{\langle jk\rangle}e^{-i\gamma \frac{w}{2}(-\sigma_j^z\otimes\sigma_k^z+I)}\\
    &=\Pi_{\langle jk\rangle}e^{-i\frac{-\gamma w}{2}(\sigma_j^z\otimes\sigma_k^z)}e^{-i\frac{\gamma w}{2}I}
\end{align*}

$e^{-i\frac{-\gamma w}{2}(\sigma_j^z\otimes\sigma_k^z)}$ can be implemented as a CNOT gate, a z-rotation gate and another CNOT gate. 
while $e^{-i\frac{\gamma w}{2}I}$ is a z-rotation gate applied to $|0\rangle$.

Therefore, an edge $\langle jk\rangle$this operator can be implemented in the circuit like FIG.\ref{fig:uc}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{quantikz}
\lstick{$\ket{x_j}$} & \ctrl{1} & \qw                     & \ctrl{1} & \qw \\
\lstick{$\ket{x_k}$} & \targ{}  & \gate{R_Z(-\gamma w)}   & \targ{}  & \qw \\
\lstick{$\ket{0}$}   & \qw      & \gate{R_Z(-\gamma w/2)} & \qw      &
\end{quantikz}
\caption{Quantum circuit for an edge $\langle jk\rangle$ in the Phase Operator }
\label{fig:uc}
\end{figure}


\subsection{The Mix Operator}
The Mix Operator contains the sum of the $\sigma_x$ operator of each qubit.
\begin{equation}
    U(B, \beta) = e^{-i\beta\sum\sigma_i^x}
\end{equation}
Therefore, the circuit is to simply add an x-rotation gate $R_{2\beta}^X$ for each qubit as FIG.\ref{fig:ub}, where
\begin{align*}
    R_{\phi}^X=cos(\phi/2)I_2-sin(\phi/2)i\sigma_x
\end{align*}

\begin{figure}
\begin{quantikz}
\lstick{$\ket{x_1}$} & \gate{R_X(2\beta)} & \qw \\
\lstick{\vdots} \\
\lstick{$\ket{x_n}$} & \gate{R_X(2\beta)} & \qw 
\end{quantikz}
\caption{Quantum circuit for the Mix Operator}
\label{fig:ub}
\end{figure}

The overall circuit is a combination of these designs. 

\section{Optimizing}

A complete process for the QAOA algorithm of depth $p$ works as below:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Choose a set of $2p$ parameters $(\vec{\gamma}, \vec{\beta})$ and use them to build the circuit
    \item Use quantum computer to get the state $\vec{\gamma}, \vec{\beta}\rangle$
    \item Measure the state in computational basis multiple times and record the resulting $|z\rangle$ with maximum $C(z)$ 
    \item Adjust parameters $(\gamma, \beta)$ and repeat steps 3 and 4 to get a better solution
    \item Output the maximum result
\end{enumerate}

The performance of QAOA greatly depends on the choice of $p$ and the parameters. Usually, $p$ is limited 
by the hardware and upstream algorithms. Therefore, how to find appropriate parameters to optimize the answer is a core problem.
This part is usually solved using classical optimization methods based on iteration. 
As a result, QAOA is divided into the category of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.

\subsection{Optimizing methods}

The most brute force method is  to iterate over a fine grid over the $[0, 2\pi]^p \times [0, \pi]^p$
space. Supposing each interval is divided into $k$ segments, the time complexity will be as large as 
$O(k^{2p})$. However, the complexity is still independent of $n$, meaning that this method can still 
have some application in occasions with small depth.

Generally, the classical optimization method can be classified into two categories. 
One is gradient-based algorithms, the most classical of which is the gradient descent. 
In this kind of method, the way of finding the gradient at a given point also varies. These methods
may achieve different performances in different situations. The other category is the gradient-free algorithm.
In our experiment, we chose Bayesian Optimization as an example. Since the quantum computer 
can be regarded as a black box for upstream algorithms, there are a great many numerical analysis methods 
to undertake this work. As long as the search space is $[0, 2\pi]^p \times [0, \pi]^p$, the complexity 
can remain independent of $n$. This is where quantum methods differ from traditional algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization Problem.

When $p$ is relatively large, there are also some tricks we can perform on the initial value of 
$(\vec{\gamma}, \vec{\beta})$. For example, use the optimal values for smaller $p$ to interplot the parameters for larger $p$.
Similar methods can greatly reduce the number of iterations needed for follow-up optimization~\cite{Zhou_2020}.

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Our Achievement}
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. We studied the principle and procedure of this algorithm in comparison with QAA, understood how the parameters work in this algorithm, and learned the circuit representation of each involved operator.

Then we design abundant experiments and deploy it using Python. Our codes are available at  \href{https://github.com/qyy2003/QAOA}{https://github.com/qyy2003/QAOA}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We implement unitary matrix operator simulation with two methods, eigenvalue decomposition and expm direct calculation, and fixed a precision disaster.
    \item We deploy three methodsÔºå grid search, Bayesian optimization and  basin-hopping trick supported L-BFGS-B algorithm, to optimize $\vec{\gamma}, \vec{\beta}$ optimization and compare their performances. It turns out that gradient-based algorithms,  L-BFGS-B in particular, have done a way better job.
    \item We study the quantum circuits construction theory and implement it with qiskit SDK, which could be run on real quantum machines. And we test our quantum circuits' performance both with and without noise. To better emulate the real noise, we use the data of a real IBM  Quantum Machines \textit{ibm\_nairob}. Then we analyze the influence of noise in different circumstances.
    \item  We study the influence of $p$ on QAOA for a given graph. Experiment results show that $F_p$ increases as $p$ grows and some fluctuation may occur due to the limitation of the optimization algorithm. Our noiseless experiments prove that
    \begin{align*}
    \lim_{p\rightarrow \infty}\max_{\vec{\gamma}, \vec{\beta}}{F_p(\vec{\gamma}, \vec{\beta})}=C_{max}(z)
    \end{align*}
    We discuss the influence of $p$ on output states both with and without noise and try some reasoning. 
    Neither too large nor too small, suitable $p$ is needed to achieve better results, according to our experiment.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Outlook}

\begin{itemize}
    \item In our work, the optimizers are based on noise-free simulators. The optimized parameters are then passed to a noisy environment in quantum computers to test their performance. However, in real applications, how to optimize the parameters in a noisy environment remains a large problem to solve.
    \item QAOA is a quantum computing method to replace classical algorithms. In our work, 
we dug into the performance of QAOA in different depth and using various optimizers, 
but haven't made a reasonable comparison between QAOA and state-of-art classical algorithms to show 
how quantum advantage appear in this field. This sort of work requires wider research on 
relative methods. 
    \item It was shown in our work that noise can greatly reduce the algorithm's 
performance and that the qubit we need is proportional to vertex number $n$. It remains to explore how 
to use as few qubits as possible to obtain similar performances as well 
as how to reduce the influence of environmental noise and detect the internal error.
